# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This is a web application for census data collection. It features a form for location details and a data table for personal enumeration. The application is built with React and uses a Node.js server for data handling.

## Implemented Features
*   **Location Details:** A form to enter location information (State, District, Tehsil, Town).
*   **Personal Enumeration:** A data grid for entering detailed personal information for multiple individuals.
*   **Draft Mode:** The application automatically saves progress and can resume from a draft.
*   **Data Persistence:** A Node.js/Express backend saves draft and final data to the file system.
*   **Vite Proxy:** The Vite development server is configured to proxy API requests to the backend.
*   **Styling:** The application has a clean, modern interface with custom CSS.

## Current Plan: UI Refinements and Workflow Automation

The following changes will be implemented to streamline the user experience:

1.  **Remove Focus Outline:** A global CSS rule (`*:focus { outline: none; }`) will be added to `src/App.css` to remove the default blue focus outline from all interactive elements, providing a cleaner look.

2.  **Simplify Location Details Component:**
    *   The `LocationDetails.jsx` component will be modified to remove the sequential, hierarchical appearance of the input fields. All four location fields (State, District, Tehsil, Town) will be visible by default when the component loads.
    *   The arrow button used to submit the location details will be removed.

3.  **Automate Data Table Loading:**
    *   The `App.jsx` component will be updated to load the `DataTable` component automatically on page load, rather than waiting for the location details to be submitted.
    *   The `isLocationSubmitted` state and related logic (`handleLocationSubmit` function, `useEffect` hook for checking drafts) will be removed, as the data table will now always be present.
